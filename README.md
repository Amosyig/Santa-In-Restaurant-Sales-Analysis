## Introduction

I designed an interactive Excel dashboard to help the manager quickly track key performance indicators (KPIs), including total and Year-to-Date (YTD) revenue by location, product category, and sales agent. This dashboard provides a quick overview of business performance, enabling the manager to make informed decisions more efficiently.



## Problem statement
1. How does total revenue vary by month for the current year compared to previous years, across different locations and product categories?
2. What is the performance of each sales agent?
3. Which products are the top and bottom performers?

## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:
- Pivot Tables 
- Slicers & Filters
- Excel Formulas
- Excel Interactive Dashboard

## Analysis
From the beginning of 2014 to mid-2016, total revenue reached $24.2 million, with a YoY growth rate of -43.35%. Revenue across four locations remained relatively consistent, with the West Coast contributing 28.68%, the East Coast 25.15%, the North Coast 23.92%, and the South Coast 22.25%. While revenue patterns were steady from 2014 to 2015, 2016 saw a deviation, particularly with a revenue peak from February to May. The revenue distribution is right-skewed, with only 10 out of 77 products contributing $500,000 or more. Among 29 sales agents, 38% contributed over $1 million, 52% between $500,000 and $1 million, and 10% less than $500,000. As of June 2016, only the Confections category showed a positive trend of 9%, with other categories expected to improve by year-end. The top five product brands by revenue are 'Thuringer Rostbratwurst,' 'Raclette Courdavault,' 'Cote de Blaye,' 'Gnocchi di Nonna Alice,' and 'Manjimup Dried Apple.'
